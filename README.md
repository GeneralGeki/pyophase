# pyophase

pyophase is our management application used for organizing an introductory week for new students. Such an introductory week is called Ophase.

## Features

### Staff Registration

People who like to help out during the Ophase, for example as tutors, can register via pyophase. The head of the Ophase can simply view all the submissions including necessary information to contact the person, etc.

### Exam Preparation

During the Ophase, new students get the possibility to write an exemplary exam to become familiar with this procedure. pyophase offers the possibility to register for this exam and helps the organizer to produce the needed organizational material.

### Miscellaneous

As the pyophase project grows, there might be some more little handy features which help solving recurring tasks.

## Data Privacy

During the organizational work, it is unavoidable to store certain data, some of which is related to individual persons. pyophase is designed in a way such that it is easy to delete all the data after it is no longer needed. The head of Ophase is told to delete this data as early as possible.
