<h3>Content and Schedule</h3>
<p>
    The Ophase starts with the welcome meeting for all new computer science students. After the welcome meeting, the
    students starting a Master's degree will gather into several groups. These groups provide the space for explaining
    different important topics and answering your questions. Topics are for example how to create an examination plan
    (Pr√ºfungsplan) , how to select courses and anything else you need to know for a successful start at the TU Darmstadt.
    Especially important is the presentation from the student advisory service (Studienberatung) with information about
    examination regulations, TUCaN, and other relevant topics.
</p>
<p>This is the Ophase schedule as of October 12th, 2016:</p>

<p>
    The Master Ophase is aimed at students who come from another university. The information on the general page about
    the Ophase is also valid for the Master Ophase (but unfortunately only available in German): We show you Darmstadt,
    the TU Darmstadt and the Computer Science department, but since you already have completed a Bachelor's degree or
    the like, we offer you an adapted schedule with more room for individual questions.
